## 🛠 My Projects

*Click on the project name to directly go to it's GitHub Repository*

- **[Infinitely Variable Transmission - IVT](https://github.com/AZarbade/infinitelyVariableTransmission_IVT)** - Miniaturizing continous variable transmission (CVT) used in vehicles for robotics applications. Based on [Inception Drive](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inception-drive-a-compact-infinitely-variable-transmission-for-robotics)

- **[Simulation Results Prediction using Neural Networks](https://github.com/AZarbade/Simulation_Prediction_ANN)** - Checking to see if using Neural Networks are capable of aiding in Analysis and Simulation fields. Work built on [Damage-potential comparisons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734743X06001965): This paper shows particles impacting bumper plates in different configurations.
