*Click on the project name to directly go to it's GitHub Repository*

- **[Infinitely Variable Transmission - IVT](https://github.com/AZarbade/infinitelyVariableTransmission_IVT)** - Miniaturizing continous variable transmission (CVT) used in vehicles for robotics applications. Based on [Inception Drive](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inception-drive-a-compact-infinitely-variable-transmission-for-robotics)

- **[Neural Networks to Interpolate Simulation Data at the Parameter Limits](https://github.com/AZarbade/Neural-Networks-to-Interpolate-Simulation-Data)** - Simulations with high accuracy can be computationally demanding, slowing down prototyping. Researchers strive to balance accuracy with limited time and computational resources. We propose using Neural Networks (NN) to reduce the computational burden and save time while maintaining accuracy. Our NN-based pipeline accelerates prototyping, enabling faster experimentation and analysis. It involves training a NN with simulation data, using it for interpolation, and efficiently obtaining accurate predictions. This work focuses on comparing damage potential by studying particle impacts on various configurations of bumper plates.
