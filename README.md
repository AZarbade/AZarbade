*Click on the project name to directly go to it's GitHub Repository*

- **[Infinitely Variable Transmission - IVT](https://github.com/AZarbade/infinitelyVariableTransmission_IVT)** - Miniaturizing continous variable transmission (CVT) used in vehicles for robotics applications. Based on [Inception Drive](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inception-drive-a-compact-infinitely-variable-transmission-for-robotics)

- **[Neural Networks to Interpolate Simulation Data at the Parameter Limits](https://github.com/AZarbade/Neural-Networks-to-Interpolate-Simulation-Data)** - Conducting simulations with the required level of accuracy can impose significant computational overhead, hindering the efficiency of the prototyping and conclusion cycle. Researchers often face challenges in finding a balance between the desired accuracy and the available time and computational resources. To address this problem, we aim to leverage Neural Networks (NN) as a means to reduce the computational burden and save time without sacrificing accuracy. By employing a NN-based pipeline, we can accelerate the prototyping process, allowing for faster experimentation and analysis. The pipeline involves training a NN using simulation data, utilizing the trained NN for interpolation, and obtaining accurate predictions efficiently. Work built on [Damage-potential comparisons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734743X06001965): This paper shows particles impacting bumper plates in different configurations.
